# UDP는 패킷 사이즈 제한이 있어서 분할해서 보내야하는데 그럴경우 UDP CustomHeader로 분할 메시지를 처리하는 프레임워크가 필요
# 파이썬 아직 이해도가 낮아 UDP는 일단 스킵

# Example of a Python UDP server

import UdpComms as U
import time

# Create UDP socket to use for sending (and receiving)
sock = U.UdpComms(udpIP="127.0.0.1", portTX=8000, portRX=8001, enableRX=True, suppressWarnings=True)

i = 0

while True:
    sock.SendData('Sent from Python: ' + str(i)) # Send this string to other application
    i += 1

    data = sock.ReadReceivedData() # read data

    if data != None: # if NEW data has been received since last ReadReceivedData function call
        print(data) # print new received data

    time.sleep(1)
